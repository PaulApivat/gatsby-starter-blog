## Why

Last year, I conducted an engagement survey for a consulting client. This involved survey construction, survey administration, data collection, data analysis and interpretation so the executive team could make personnel decisions.

Making sense of the data was a challenge.

People in organizations vary in their comfort with statistical data. While I enjoy discussing the fundamentals of correlation and regression, I realized we needed _better tools_ to visualize the data.

Coming off Labs, I want to do an _independent_ Labs so I can build a survey data visualization tool. This will help me refine skills and build a portfolio piece that's connected to the work i'm doing.
