## Part 1 - Individual Accomplishment this Sprint

For this sprint, I did a number of tasks including:

1. Create the first draft of our project's documentation. [source](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/labspt2-auto-invoicer/blob/master/README2.md)

2. Implement _form validation_ to ensure that users fill out all necessary input fields on the Invoice before submitting the data to the backend.

3. Create an Edit Popup Modal so users can click on any row on the Invoice List and make updates to Total, Amount Paid and Balance Due.

4. Transition Invoice Form content to a new "Steppers" layout. The team felt this presentational flow would be more user-friendly.

5. Create an Invoice Summary form to accompany the new steppers-layout for creating an invoice. This summary form will auto-populate as a user progresses through the five stages creating an invoice.

### Part 2 - Weekly Reflection

As we entered the final sprint, we realized that in order for our App to be fully polished and, more importantly, something we could show _prospective employers_, we needed more time. As a group we agreed that it was more important for us to come out of Labs with a project we're really proud of, so we agreed to extend by one more sprint.

Its invigorating to be on a team where everyone really cares about the final product, so it was an easy choice to make in pushing off CS by two weeks.

We all want the App to be _really_ nice and something we're proud of. The flip side of this is we, at times, dance on the line between "going the extra mile" and "scope creep". We have a lot of new features we want to implement including: a dashboard, a customer page, a 404 page, implementing Hooks for Global state, changing the invoice form layout. All of these features are intended to improve user experience. And yet, it's not always clear what is scope creep - often time these features came up as we got more experience developing the Application.

Nevertheless, we all try to do what's best for the team.

We have functionality and design from prior sprints, but the challenge is integrating that into the new layout that we want to implement.
